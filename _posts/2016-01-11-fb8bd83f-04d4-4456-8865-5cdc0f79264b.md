## Kodak Gallery Award

Kodak introduced the Gallery Awards in 1985 as a way to honor and promote the importance and value of excellence in professional photography.

Kodak has always represented quality imaging through its many products and services and will continue to work to elevate the importance of professional, quality imaging within the industry, as well as with customers. It's a connection we're pleased to make.

Therefore, we are delighted, once again, to salute and support outstanding professional photography and photographers by presenting the annual KODAK Gallery and KODAK Gallery Elite Awards. The Gallery Awards are judged on a state or regional basis, with winners going on to compete at the national level for the Gallery Elite Award.

Gallery Awards will be presented, throughout the year, at annual Professional Photographers of America (PPA) regional and state conventions --- in addition to those events' customary awards.
